# 🚨 CRITICAL FEATURE AUDIT - AEOlytics

## ❌ **MISSING HIGH-VALUE FEATURES** (Customer Expectations Not Met)

### **1. API Access (Agency Plan - $199/month)**
**Status:** ❌ **COMPLETELY MISSING**
**Impact:** 🔴 **CRITICAL** - This is a dealbreaker for enterprise customers
**What's Expected:**
```
GET /api/v1/citations
GET /api/v1/queries  
GET /api/v1/analytics
POST /api/v1/queries
```
**Reality:** No API endpoints exist

### **2. Team Collaboration (Agency Plan)**
**Status:** ❌ **COMPLETELY MISSING** 
**Impact:** 🔴 **CRITICAL** - Agencies need multi-user access
**What's Expected:**
- User roles (admin, editor, viewer)
- Team member invitations
- Shared workspaces
- Permission management
**Reality:** Single-user only

### **3. Slack/Notion Integrations (Pro Plan - $49/month)**
**Status:** ❌ **MISSING**
**Impact:** 🟠 **HIGH** - Promised feature not delivered
**What's Expected:**
- Slack webhook notifications
- Notion database sync
- Automated report sharing
**Reality:** Only email reports exist

## ⚠️ **PLAN RESTRICTION FAILURES**

### **4. Free Plan Engine Access**
**Status:** 🔴 **WRONG IMPLEMENTATION**
**Problem:** Free users get ALL engines (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini)
**Should Be:** ChatGPT only
**Impact:** Undermines Pro plan value proposition

| Feature | Free | Pro | Agency | Status |
|---------|------|-----|---------|---------|
| Query Limits | 50 | 1,000 | 10,000 | ✅ Working |

## 🎯 **RECOMMENDATIONS**

### **Immediate Fixes (Week 1)**
1. **Restrict Free Plan** - Limit to ChatGPT only
2. **Remove misleading features** from pricing until implemented
3. **Add "Coming Soon" badges** for unimplemented features

### **Priority Development (Weeks 2-4)**
1. **API Development** - Critical for Agency plan retention
2. **Team Management** - User invitations, roles, permissions
3. **Slack Integration** - Webhook notifications

### **Nice-to-Have (Month 2+)**

2. Advanced team features
3. Custom integrations

## 🚨 **LEGAL/ETHICAL CONCERNS**

**You're charging for features that don't exist.**

**Pro Plan ($49/month):**
- ❌ Slack/Notion integrations (promised, not delivered)

**Agency Plan ($199/month):**
- ❌ API access (promised, not delivered) 
- ❌ Team collaboration (promised, not delivered)

**Recommendation:** Either implement these features immediately or remove them from pricing until ready.

## 💰 **REVENUE IMPACT**

**Current State:**
- Free users get too much value (all engines)
- Pro users missing promised integrations
- Agency users missing core enterprise features

**Risk:** High churn rate when customers realize missing features

**Solution:** Honest pricing + rapid feature development
